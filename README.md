# üñºÔ∏è Ubuntu Image Fetcher  

> **"I am because we are." ‚Äì Ubuntu Philosophy**  
> This project embodies the spirit of community and sharing by respectfully fetching images from the internet and organizing them for later appreciation.  

---

## üåç About  
The **Ubuntu Image Fetcher** is a Python tool that:  
- Prompts the user for one or more image URLs  
- Creates a directory called `Fetched_Images` if it doesn‚Äôt exist  
- Downloads the images and saves them locally  
- Handles errors gracefully, ensuring respect for community resources  

This script demonstrates the Ubuntu principles of **community, respect, sharing, and practicality**.

## ‚ú® Features  
- ‚úÖ Fetch images from the web using the `requests` library  
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple URLs at once (comma-separated input)  
- ‚úÖ Skips non-image content types  
- ‚úÖ Prevents downloads larger than 10MB  
- ‚úÖ Skips duplicates (won‚Äôt overwrite existing files)  
- ‚úÖ Saves images in a neatly organized folder (`Fetched_Images`)

Connection strengthened. Community enriched.
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions

When fetching from unknown sources, this program:

Ensures the file is actually an image (Content-Type check)

Prevents downloading overly large files (limit: 10 MB)

Skips duplicates to avoid overwriting existing images



üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

Auto-rename duplicate filenames (e.g., image(1).jpg, image(2).jpg)

Support for downloading from text files containing lists of URLs

Optional caching with ETag / Last-Modified headers



üí° Ubuntu Principles in Action

Community: Connects to the wider web to gather resources

Respect: Handles errors gracefully without crashing

Sharing: Organizes images in a structured folder for later use

Practicality: Provides a real-world utility in a simple form
